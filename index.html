<p><b>Art</b> is a mode of communication which not only helps reveal the creative side, but also thoughts,emotions, experiences and ideas.Art as a whole is a combinationof skill and imagination.
	<p>Each of the various art mediums can be used to produce unique styles, and we’ll explore them in detail to help you make the best decision for your creative goals.</p>
<h3><b><big>Elements of Art</big></b></h3>
<p ><i>An artwork is a combination of two or more elements.There are 7 elements used in any form of Art. Artists blend these seven forms of elements and express it into their work. It is not necessary to contain each one of them in a work, but there's atleast two of them in every one.</i>

<p>While there are plenty of options to choose from, there are several mediums that are popular with painters all over the world: acrylic, watercolor, oil, gouache, ink etc. These paint mediums are the most versatile and allow artists the greatest flexibility when trying to create a certain look or style.</p>

 <a id="WaterColour"><b>Water Color-Technique and Pigment</b></a>

	<p>	Watercolor paint contains two main ingredients: finely ground pigment (which provides the color) and gum arabic (which acts as a binder). Pigment is mixed with water to make it transparent and usable.Although this allows you to create interesting effects, the fluidity of watercolor paint sometimes makes it a challenge to work with.With watercolors you can paint in virtually any genre, from landscapes and cityscapes (like my painting of Florence above) to vibrant abstracts and sharp photorealist paintings. They're non-toxic, easy to clean, and with proper planning you can paint quite quickly.

<a id="AcrylicColour"><b>Acrylic Colour-Technique and Pigment</b></a>

 <p> Acrylic paint is not a complex paint as it is made of only three ingredients: pigment, an acrylic binder, and what is known as an acrylic vehicle.The pigment is what gives the paint its color. It is made up of small granules that are ground down into tiny particles that are suspended in the paint without dissolving. The pigment can be natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic.The binder used in acrylic paint is known as an acrylic polymer. It has two roles. The first is to hold the pigment in place when the paint has dried. The second is to form a protective film once the water has evaporated from the paint.In the case of acrylics, water is the vehicle that transports the binder and the pigment. When water combines with the binder, it forms a polymer emulsion. Once the water has evaporated the paint dries to a clear polymer film that contains particles of colored pigment.

<a id="PosterColour"><b>Poster Color-Technique and Pigment</b></a>

 <p>Poster paint can be used in the same way as acrylic paint, but has a speedier drying time. This is what makes poster paint ideal for using in a playgroup, workshop or art club setting. Unlike many acrylic paints, our poster paint is fully washable, so you can make a mess without worrying about disastrous consequences to clothes, furniture or faces. The amazing water-soluble characteristic that poster paint flourishes with means it can be diluted to create an opaque watercolour-style texture or mixed with PVA glue to create a glossy, thick, oil paint like texture.

 <a id="OilColour"><b>Oil Color-Technique and Pigment</b></a>
<p>Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Traditional oil paints require an oil that always hardens, forming a stable, impermeable film. Such oils are called causative, or drying, oils, and are characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids.When exposed to air, oils do not undergo the same evaporation process that water does. Instead, they dry semisolid. The rate of this process can be very slow, depending on the oil.

 <a id="PastelColour"><b>Pastel Color-Technique and Pigment</b></a>
<img src="pastel.png" alt="pastelcolor"  align=left height=100 width=150>
<p>Pastels or pastel colors are a family of colors of any hue characterized by relatively high lightness and low saturation.They are named after an artistic medium made from pigment and solid binding agents, similar to crayons. Pastel sticks historically tended to have lower saturation than paints of the same pigment, hence the name of the color family.
Pink, mauve,and baby blue are commonly used pastel colors, as well as mint green, peach, periwinkle, and lavender.

 <a id="GouacheColour"><b>Gouache Color-Technique and Pigment</b></a>
<img src="gouache.jpg" alt="gouachecolor"  align=right height=140 width=150>
<p>Gouache is an ‘opaque watercolour’ or ‘body colour’.This basically means that it uses the same pigments and gum arabic binder as watercolour but has white added to it so that it loses the translucency of watercolour. As a result, it dries to a flat, matt colour that reproduces exceedingly well making it ideal for Commercial Art, Illustration and posters. White Gouache is also often used to add intense highlights to watercolour paintings.
Designer’s or Artist's Gouache uses the very best pigments to achieve brilliant, vibrant colours that are lightfast, smooth and solid. Quick-drying, bold and requiring no mediums, it is very popular with students as well as commercial artists and will appear on most college’s list of required materials. It can be used straight from the tube or thinned with water to be applied in washes but will not let you build up many layers of wash as pure watercolour would. Unlike Acrylic, it is not waterproof when dry.
